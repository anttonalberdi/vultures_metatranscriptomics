# Vultures metatranscriptomics
Drakkar processing of vultures metatranscriptomics

## Preprocess reads
Quality-filtering and host read removal.

```{sh}
conda activate drakkar
drakkar preprocessing -i reads -r reference/GCA_000699945.1_ASM69994v1_genomic.fna.gz -e /projects/alberdilab/data/environments/drakkar
```

## Annotate bins
Annotation of MAGs already generated by the EHI pipeline.

```{sh}
conda activate drakkar
drakkar annotating -b bins --annotation-type function -e /projects/alberdilab/data/environments/drakkar
```

## Quantify expression
Use bin annotations to quantify gene expression.

```{sh}
conda activate drakkar
drakkar expressing -b bins -e /projects/alberdilab/data/environments/drakkar
```
